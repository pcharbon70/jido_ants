# Summary: Phase 1.1.2 - Configure Dependencies

**Date:** 2025-01-14
**Feature Branch:** `feature/phase1-1.1.2-dependencies`
**Planning Document:** `notes/planning/phase1_foundational_simulation/01-project-setup.md`
**Working Plan:** `notes/feature/phase1-1.1.2-dependencies.md`

## Overview

Successfully implemented section 1.1.2 of Phase 1: Configure Dependencies. Added all required production and development dependencies to mix.exs and verified compilation.

## Completed Tasks

### 1.1.2.1 Add Production Dependencies
- Located the `deps/0` function in `mix.exs`
- Added `{:jido, path: "../jido"}` - Using local path for development (links to local v2 branch)
- Added `{:phoenix_pubsub, "~> 2.1"}` - For agent communication via PubSub

### 1.1.2.2 Add Development Dependencies
- Added `{:ex_doc, "~> 0.30", only: :dev, runtime: false}` - Documentation generator
- Added `{:dialyxir, "~> 1.4", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false}` - Static analysis tool
- Added `{:credo, "~> 1.7", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false}` - Code linting

### 1.1.2.3 Fetch and Compile Dependencies
- Ran `mix deps.get` - Successfully fetched 60+ packages
- Ran `mix deps.compile` - All dependencies compiled without errors
- Verified `deps/` contains `jido_action` and `phoenix_pubsub` (jido is path dependency)

## Additional Work: Project Restructure

During implementation, discovered that the Elixir project was nested in a `jido_ants/` subdirectory. Restructured to flatten the project:

**Before:**
```
/home/ducky/code/agentjido/jido_ants/
├── jido_ants/          # Unnecessary nesting
│   ├── mix.exs
│   ├── lib/
│   └── test/
├── notes/
└── planning/
```

**After:**
```
/home/ducky/code/agentjido/jido_ants/
├── mix.exs            # Top level
├── lib/
├── test/
├── _build/
├── deps/
├── notes/
└── planning/
```

## Dependencies Added

**Production:**
- `jido` (local path) - Agent framework
- `phoenix_pubsub` 2.2.0 - PubSub for communication
- Plus 50+ transitive dependencies from jido

**Development:**
- `ex_doc` 0.39.3 - Documentation
- `dialyxir` 1.4.7 - Dialyzer
- `credo` 1.7.15 - Linting

## Test Results

```
Compiling 2 files (.ex)
Generated ant_colony app
Running ExUnit with seed: 578540, max_cases: 40

..
Finished in 0.08 seconds (0.00s async, 0.08s sync)
1 doctest, 1 test, 0 failures
```

## Updated mix.exs

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    # Jido Agent Framework (local v2 branch for development)
    {:jido, path: "../jido"},

    # PubSub for agent communication
    {:phoenix_pubsub, "~> 2.1"},

    # Documentation
    {:ex_doc, "~> 0.30", only: :dev, runtime: false},

    # Dialyzer for static analysis
    {:dialyxir, "~> 1.4", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},

    # Credo for code linting
    {:credo, "~> 1.7", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

## Next Steps

The next section to implement would be **1.1.3 Set Up Directory Structure** which involves:
- Creating `lib/ant_colony/actions/` directory
- Creating `lib/ant_colony/agent/` directory
- Creating `lib/ant_colony/plane/` directory
- Creating mirrored test directory structure
- Adding `.gitkeep` files to empty directories

## Notes

- Jido is linked via local path `../jido` for faster development iteration
- The jido dependency pulls in many transitive packages including jido_action, jido_signal, and various utilities
- All dependencies compiled successfully with only minor warnings from third-party packages
